# .gitignore for Terraform

# Local Terraform state files
# These files may contain sensitive information and are specific to a local workspace.
# If you are using a remote backend (like S3, GCS, or Terraform Cloud),
# which is highly recommended, these files won't be created locally for your main state.
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup

# Terraform plan files
# Plan files can expose sensitive variable values. It's better to generate them
# on-the-fly in your CI/CD pipeline.
*.tfplan

# Terraform provider plugins and modules
# This directory is created by `terraform init` and contains the downloaded
# provider plugins and modules. These should be fetched by each user/system
# running `terraform init`.
.terraform/

# Crash log files
# These are generated if Terraform crashes and are useful for debugging, but not for version control.
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Terraform Cloud/Enterprise credentials
# These files can contain authentication tokens.
terraform.rc
*.terraform.rc
*.terraform.lock.hcl

# Variable definition files
# It's a best practice to ignore `.tfvars` files to avoid committing sensitive
# values like passwords or API keys. Instead, commit a `.tfvars.example` file.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json
*.auto.tfvars
*.auto.tfvars.json

# Override files
# These are used to override parts of your configuration, often for local testing.
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# CLI configuration files
.terraformrc

# Terragrunt-specific files (if you use Terragrunt)
.terragrunt-cache/
*.terragrunt-cache.lock

# Fuzzy temporary files
._*.tf
._*.tf.json
